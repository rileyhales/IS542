HW 5 report

This homework was really useful in practicing encapsulation just like homework 4. I've learned a lot by following the 
videos and trying to match JSlint. One of the things i wanted to get from this class was to learn better JS coding  
practices to make clean and efficient code. I got a JSlint plugin for my IDE before starting this hw I tried to code 
the way JSlint wants you to and I feel like that has taught me a lot about common javascript mistakes. This homework 
also taught me a lot about not needing jquery. Most of the javascript I've written before used jquery because the 
person who taught me javascript used it for everything. I had no idea it was so easy to write code for ajax without 
javascript. I have a really simply web page for my personal website and i used jquery for the click events. After this 
hw i realized i don't need that and i used youmightnotneedjquery.com to learn how to convert it all to vanilla javascript.
