This assignment was difficult because I didn't know how to use promises. It took me a lot of reading and some practice
to figure out how to chain together the ".then()" functions. Once i got the hang of that, it wasn't too hard to figure
out how to replace the ajax function with fetch code. I tried replacing the contents of the ajax function with equivalent
fetch code and also replacing every time i used the ajax function with fetch code. I thought it made a bit more sense
to remove the ajax function and put fetch code directly into the other functions where i needed it. However that's
probably only true because there are 3 total places where i need it in the app. If i needed it more extensively then
wrapping my fetch code with the ajax function would make more sense. I ultimately just replaced the ajax function's code
with the with fetch code instead of the XML Http request.

In comparing my solution to yours, I was happy to see that the way I did the breadcrumbs navigation was very similar to
you. My function for injectBreadcrumbs was very similar. However, i call that function only once as part of the event
for onHashChanged rather than from within each of the navigation changing functions. One place we differed was in not
having duplicate markers. I checked that the markers' latitudes and longitudes were exactly the same. I assumed that
since the numbers and the number of decimal points are pretty small, it would probably be safe to compare the numbers
directly.
