This project taught me about writing both good functions and useful functions. I found myself rewriting a few of my
functions so that they were more generic and able to handle all the cases i needed them to. While i was trying to build
the next/previous chapter buttons and breadcrumbs, I felt like i needed to rewrite the ajax function so i could pass
more arguments about the request and use that. eventually i realized i could just have all my functions read the hash.
I think i was worried about writing really inefficient code but i found that this was much faster. I thought about
writing the parts of the hash to a private variable in the Scriptures object every time the hash changed but ultimately
settled on writing a function for parsing the hash which can be called everywhere else that i need it. I think the
whole time that i was trying to write a bunch of super customizable functions "good" functions when really what i
needed was to just write a few really useful functions that make the more complicated functions easier to write.

In addition to fulfilling all the requirements on the rubric, i implemented the breadcrumbs navigation and made the map
zoom to the americas when you're viewing the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants. There aren't many, if any,
tags with georeferencing in the book of mormon but i thought it would still be useful to move the map still for context.
I worked with Kyler in our class on figuring out some of the hard parts that weren't included in the videos and that
was very helpful. I think thats what really helped me finish the code make it as efficient as it is. I'm looking
forward to learning the styling parts.
